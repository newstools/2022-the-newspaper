The South African Chefs Association (SA Chefs) and The Plant Powered Show (TPPS) has launched a culinary competition where the winner will share a platform with top professional and celebrity chefs at The Plant Powered Show. The show takes place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) from Friday, May 27 – Sunday, May 29.
The not-to-be-missed three-day live in-person event will also incorporate an exciting virtual component, which will allow visitors from other provinces and around the globe to attend online. The Plant Powered Show is the first of its kind in South Africa, bringing the plant-based, vegetarian, vegan and conscious living revolution to a mainstream audience. The hugely successful inaugural Plant Powered Show (under the name The Festive Vegan & Plant Powered Show) took place online in 2020. The 2022 competition is open to all chefs, student chefs and home cooks residing in South Africa, aged 28 and younger, who are invited to submit their best vegan dish. Those entering must submit a 30-second video (or a link to where the video can be found) explaining why they should be the winner of a coveted demo spot at the TPPS, as well as a recipe using vegan-only products with a list of ingredients and the cooking method.
Entries, along with a full name, ID, email and cell number details should be sent to competitions@sachefs.co.za for the attention of Adrian Vigus-Brown. Entries close at midday on April 19 with the top 10 finalists announced on April 22. These finalists will then have until April 29 to submit a demo video with the ultimate winner announced on May 2 and invited to be part of The Plant Powered Show to perform a live cooking demo on Saturday, May 28, in The Plant Kitchen Chef’s Theatre.
