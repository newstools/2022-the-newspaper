Given the hard work that has gone into championing values as an integral part of their learning culture, the leadership and staff of Courtrai Primary School in the Cape Winelands Education District (CWED) are determined to build on the foundations laid in their strong values programme. “We were adamant not to replace our value’s system that all role players of our school have so overwhelmingly embraced for the last few years; in fact, if anything, we wanted to strengthen it,” said Jan Brand, principal at Courtrai. Brand added that in the last term of 2021 all grades were asked for suggestions on how to take their “values education” forward – and that’s where the idea of a values theme for the year was born. Their theme for 2022 is ‘Courage’. Brand challenged his staff and learners to: have the courage to make a difference this year – in all aspects, from discipline in class, caring, academics, sport, culture, etc. To have the courage to try one new thing this year, and have the courage to participate. Furthermore, ‘courage’ would also be part of all gatherings in the school hall for each phase to display and engage with. The school discussed it with parents at the beginning of the year and received positive feedback.
