The City of Cape Town has issued the final race permit for the Two Oceans Marathon this coming weekend. The decision was made following lengthy revision of the Two Oceans Marathon NPC event plans and supporting documents as required by the Events By-Law together with the Safety at Sports and Recreational Events Act. The City is satisfied that the event organiser has met the requirements. After extensive, albeit belated, efforts by the race organisers to properly consult affected churches, there is now a clear traffic plan for churches that will ensure Easter services can go ahead. The City of Cape Town recognises the importance of religious institutions in our society and respects the Constitutional rights of Christians honouring their faith by attending church service on Easter as well as other faith-based activities that may be taking place during this weekend. To mitigate the impact on any worshippers or other individuals going about their business, the City’s Traffic Services will work with marathon marshals to ensure worshippers are able to gain access to intersections along the route and ensure they are not unreasonably restricted in reaching their properties or places of business at all times. Additionally, the Two Ocean Marathon board has committed to moving the event away from Easter Weekend in future.
