As a passionate fitness enthusiast who also believes in supporting really positively impactful initiatives, Liezel van der Westhuizen will be open water swimming 7.5km, from the historic Robben Island to Big Bay, with a small group of NSRI volunteers, for the fundraising of their Water Safety Education & Survival Swimming programmes. “So far, the non-profit National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has impacted the lives of more than 3 000 children and many communities, through their water safety programs, and I wanted to do my part in helping lower the figure of 29% of fatal drownings occurring among kids under 14 years old,” Liezel said. Renowned fitness enthusiast Liezel van der Westhuizen has already taken on the likes of IronMan triathlons, endurance competitions, and sports challenges like tandem cycling the Himalayans with a blind athlete. Her latest conquest is another challenge with heart: taking on a challenging swim, for NSRI swim programs that are saving lives. Liezel is a volunteer in the NSRI Coastal watcher’s programme. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) is a non-profit organization full of volunteers who want to educate and inform, save lives, and uplift communities however they can. Some of their volunteers will be undertaking a swim crossing to Big Bay, from the historic Robben Island, to raise funds and awareness for the NSRI’s Water Safety Education & Survival Swimming programmes. So far, Liezel has raised R2 500, and the NSRI organization has a target of R100,000 for this fundraising initiative.
