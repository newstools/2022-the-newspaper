Award-winning Stellenbosch wine estate Vergenoegd Löw will soon be home to Clara’s Barn, a new restaurant concept located in one of South Africa’s oldest barns. The genius behind this new restaurant is none other than renowned chef Bertus Basson. This will be the second restaurant that Basson launches at the well-known wine estate. Clara’s Barn plans to open within the first week of March this year. Basson has been involved with Vergenoegd Löw wine estate since 2019 and says that one of the major drawcards of the new restaurant is that it will be located in one of the oldest barns in South Africa. Clara’s Barn’s kitchen will be headed by Chef Drikus Brink.
Although set in a barn, the restaurant will boast modern decor and also feature an additional space that can be used for functions of up to 80 people. The restaurant concept is rooted in a “farm kitchen” approach with a twist, as Basson says the food offering will be refined three- and five-course menu options. Staying true to the cattle farm roots of the wine estate, Clara’s Barn will be serving meaty dishes in an ode to its heritage. Basson explains why he chose to open up a second restaurant at the wine estate. “This area is very central – a great meeting point for friends from Cape Town and the Winelands. The Winelands is wonderful for family, and we have a wonderful lifestyle here.” Running and operating two restaurants in the same area poses its challenges, but Basson is optimistic and shares that it has more positives to it.
