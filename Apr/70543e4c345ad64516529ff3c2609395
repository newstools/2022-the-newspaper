Entries are now open for the fourth compelling iteration of the Nando’s Hot Young Designer (HYD) talent search. This face-off seeks to unearth saucy new designs for Nando’s restaurants around the world, and fire up the careers of emerging local creatives. This time around, entrants have been tasked with designing a condiment unit which will display the brand’s acclaimed Peri Peri sauces. The challenge is to do so in such a way that these sauces and their piquant ingredients, which form an intrinsic part of the Nando’s experience, remain visible and accessible to customers throughout their visit.
The end goal is to list the winning condiment unit on The Portal to Africa – Nando’s online marketplace, where interior designers working on Nando’s restaurants around the world can shop for original pieces of furniture and lighting that are designed and manufactured in South Africa. Past years called for lighting solutions, patterns and benches; and these prior competition rounds have seen their respective finalists and winners propelled into the limelight and mentored in all things related to creating a sustainable business. In 2020 are previous winners that have gone on to evolve and grow within the discipline. Up-and-coming designers are challenged to bring their own “sauce” by entering vibrant, yet functional, conversation pieces, whose inspiration is rooted right here at home, on the African continent. Entries close on 31 May 2022. To enter visit www.clout-sadesign.co.za
