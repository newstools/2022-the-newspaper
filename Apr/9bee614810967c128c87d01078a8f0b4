eDEAF, a Deaf owned company that provides SETA accredited training with the goal of empowering Deaf communities for business, are extremely proud of eighteen of their staff members for successfully completing a Corporate MBA (cMBA). SkillsTown, in collaboration with eDEAF, made the learning accessible to the Deaf by converting all the training material into South African Sign Language (SASL). “Sadly, accessible Deaf education is scarce, and we are therefore delighted that this platform truly enables equal access to education for the Deaf community,” says Nicky Bezuidenhout, eDEAF Marketing & Communications Manager. The cMBA is disrupting the world of leadership development. Whilst the cMBA does not replace the traditional MBA, which is academic and scientific, it focusses on offering a scalable, practical leadership development program to develop all levels of management. The eight-month program covered eight modules including: management and leadership, sales and marketing, organisation, strategy, innovation, human resource management and finance. The cMBA aims to develop leadership skills and business process awareness by offering theory principals to participants that can be applied immediately within their respective work environments. Through their partnered solutions approach, eDEAF strives to provide the open labour market with trained and skilled Deaf people who are ready to become part of the mainstream economy. eDEAF has grown to a staff complement of 62 (82% of whom are Deaf), and operates from four training hubs in Johannesburg, Pretoria, the Western Cape and Kwa-Zulu Natal.
