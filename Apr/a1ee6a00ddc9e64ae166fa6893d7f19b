Connecting with people outside our immediate family, extended family, and work colleagues after two years of disconnection can be somewhat daunting. Many may feel a sense of anxiety when it comes to being around people again, even with Covid protocols in place.
However, Society Cappuccinos is encouraging South Africans to take the plunge and initiate connecting with friends and loved ones again, whether in person, or over a phone call or video call, based on the fundamental belief that we really are better together. To bring people together, Society has launched a new Mochaccino which unites two things’ people love – coffee and chocolate.
Society Mochaccinos are made from the finest 100% Arabica coffee beans paired with indulgent Cocoa – bringing together premium coffee and chocolate for an indulgent taste experience.
“Society Cappuccinos is a brand that promotes connection, conversations, and coming together – because we know as humans we can’t live without connection,” says Society’s COO, Natalie White.
“That’s why we’re bringing people together over our newest launch, Society Mochaccino.”
“This combines two things most people can’t live without – coffee and chocolate!” Enjoy the new Society Mochaccino in one of three ways: The Hot Mocha, Iced Mocha or Mochaccino Milkshake. Society Cappuccinos are available in packs of 8s in 5 delicious flavours: Sweetened, Vanilla, c, Caramel Toffee and Moccachino.
