Registrations opened for Africa Travel Week 2022, which is scheduled to go ahead from 11 – 13 April in the Host City of Cape Town. The trade show will once again bring together pan-African & international exhibitors as well as buyers from across the globe at headline shows, World Travel Market Africa (WTM Africa) and International Luxury Travel Market Africa (ILTM Africa). For those buyers who may be unable to travel to Cape Town, Africa Travel Week has created a digital event that will run from 4 – 5 April. Both one-on-one meetings and virtual speed networking sessions will be available on the same platform that was successfully used for ATW Virtual 2021. The virtual event is exclusive to exhibitors and buyers only.
Different buyers will attend the live event and the virtual event, meaning that exhibitors will receive marked value as the buyers that they will meet online will be different to those that will be attending the physical event, thereby offering a diverse and enhanced pool of buyers. The highly anticipated live event in the host city of Cape Town will include all the highlights delegates have come to expect in previous events, including a robust speaker programme and associated events like International Business Market Africa, EQUAL Africa, Travel Forward, Sports and Events Tourism Exchange (SETE) and the Africa Tourism Investment Summit (ATIS). Attendees can look forward to attending conference sessions with speakers from around the globe, face-to-face networking, the African Responsible Tourism Awards, press conferences and more!
