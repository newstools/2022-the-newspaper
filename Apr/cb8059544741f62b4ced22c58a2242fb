Small visitors can experience a world of fun at the Cape Village where ice skating, movies, ten-pin bowling, lazer tag and a myriad of arcade games will send them home exhausted, but happy. GrandWest is offering a choice of two value-for-money kids fun packs suitable for children aged 5 – 17 valid until 30 June 2022.
