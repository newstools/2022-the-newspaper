La Récolte Retirement Village, a luxury estate situated in Stellenberg in the Northern Suburbs of Cape Town, has launched Block D, the final phase of the development. The development’s completed Blocks A and B are sold out, with Assisted Living suites and independent Living apartments available for purchase or rent. The development group’s managing director, Jaco Steyn of Steyter Construction, adds that the development suits the varied requirements of retirees. “La Récolte offers three very important benefits – location, security and comfort. We’re one of very few developments where we can honestly say that it’s your retirement on your terms.” “All services such as house cleaning, laundry and catering services can be arranged to suit your lifestyle and budget. Furthermore, we pride ourselves on the fact that our units are spacious compared to other developments. We offer a comprehensive product at an affordable rate.” Jessica Kolver-Louw, property sales agent for the C4 Property Group, says: “The estate offers the perfect mix of tranquil living and city amenities, with tailor-made care packages to choose from.” According to Kolver-Louw, the development’s excellent location plays a huge role in its success. “It’s situated close to Tyger Valley Shopping Centre, Willowbridge, the Durbanville Winelands, acclaimed Welgemoed golf course, hospitals and clinics, as well as the N1 freeway. Our more than 150 residents in Blocks A, B and C enjoy their new homes and the simplicity of a relaxed, lock-up and go lifestyle.”
Block D will sell from R1 695 000 to R2 985 000 for a spacious apartment and parking included. For more information visit www.larecolte.co.za, call Jessica Kolver-Louw on 074 888 2132, or e-mail on jessicak@c4propertygroup.co.za
