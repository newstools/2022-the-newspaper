The Two Oceans Marathon (TOM) will once again be run over the Easter Weekend. The 2022 running of the Ultra Marathon will be its 51st since inception, marking the start of the second fifty years of existence for this jewel event on the Western Cape’s calendar of highlights.

For the first time in its history, the race will be run over two days. The Half Marathon takes place on 16 April 2022, and the Ultra Marathon will be run on 17 April 2022. The Two Oceans Marathon (TOM) is proud to announce that is has signed leading sports apparel giant Totalsports as its new title sponsor. “Totalsports is a firm believer in the unifying power of running and our investment is a celebration of the enduring spirit of runners everywhere, in overcoming the challenges of the past two years. It’s great to finally see our running community excited about taking part in landmark events like Two Oceans again,” says TFG CEO Anthony Thunström.
TOM strongly encourages runners to complete a physical road race as their qualifier. However, any officially timed and measured marathon or longer distance, whether in the form of an officially organised virtual or physical race, run after 1 July 2021 can be used as your qualifier.
