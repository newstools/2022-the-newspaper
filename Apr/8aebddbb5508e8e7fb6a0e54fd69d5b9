In an interview with Belga press agency, Air Belgium CEO Niky announced that Air Belgium would have 11 aeroplanes at the end of 2022, four A330neo for passenger traffic, enabling the launch of new routes to South Africa, and seven mixed-fleet aircraft for freight. Chinese logistics company Hongyuan has taken a 49% stake in Air Belgium by a 19.3 million Euro capital increase, but the majority of the shares remain in Belgian hands
Two Boeing 747-8 Freighters are added to the fleet, which will also get more Airbus A330 cargo planes when the contract between Air Belgium and French shipping company CMA CGM expires at the end of this year. They will be painted in the mixed colours of Air Belgium and Hongyuan. For the winter season, Air Belgium will take off for South Africa from Brussels, with three flights per week, simultaneously to Johannesburg and Cape Town.
