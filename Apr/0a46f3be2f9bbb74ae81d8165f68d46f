Bright yellow sunflowers are synonymous with summer, positivity and happy times – and there’s no better place to celebrate sunflower season than at Vergelegen wine estate in Somerset West. A vast tract of sunflowers is in full bloom near the Stables family restaurant, which currently offers sunflower-themed items on the menu. Visitors are snapping selfies against the sunflower backgrounds and buying bunches of sunflowers to take home. “We first sowed a large packet of sunflower seeds last year, to brighten up the garden area at the entrance to the new arboretum,” says MD Wayne Coetzer. “We were overwhelmed at the response. People travelled long distances to take selfies in the sunflowers, and we sold hundreds of flowers.” “This inspired us to take it to the next level and to organise a proper sunflower celebration this year.” The Stables restaurant is decorated with freshly cut flowers – even the life-size wooden horse at the entrance has sunflowers decorating his mane. The waitrons are sporting new outfits with “Vergelegen is blooming amazing” and guests are snapping photographs against the background of bright yellow flowers. Says Stables sous chef Roger Hindley: “We’ve incorporated sunflowers and their seeds into several dishes, and it’s the visual effect of the petals that makes an impact.”
