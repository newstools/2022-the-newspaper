Hot on the heels of a hugely successful “mini” Classics for All festival in early December last year, comes the 18th Greyton Genadendal Classics for All Festival, back in its original, annual calendar slot of May. Now in its 18th year, Classics for All is a small, intimate and unpretentious get-together for music lovers from all walks of life. The ethos behind this festival is to take audiences on an accessible classical music adventure, catering for the tastes of everyone, from the aficionado to the lesser devotee. Nine concerts will be performed at the 2022 Classics for All Festival from 20 – 22 May where classical music lovers can enjoy a weekend of beautiful music, comfort food, warm fires and the amazing ambience of the neighbouring villages Greyton and Genadendal. Tickets are available from Computicket
