The Old Tannery is situated on the edge of Wellington, alongside the Krom River. Once a manufacturer of various leathered goods, the now landmark “Old Tannery” is a New, Hot, Mixed-use destination offering trendy office and retail space, a coffee shop and other leisure as well as family attractions. The heritage site offers the ideal “artisanal appeal” and is a photographer’s dream, hence its popularity as a wedding venue and tourism attraction. The Old Tannery Coffee Shop is also a must-visit destination for coffee lovers, as you can appreciate a cup of joy with our famous carrot cake, hearty baked items from Chef Lisa, all-day breakfast or even grab some Asian dishes authentically prepared by a Thai Chef.
