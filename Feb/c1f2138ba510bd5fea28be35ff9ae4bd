South Africa’s premier 3-Day Stage Race, the THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN will celebrate its 12th anniversary at the picturesque Houw Hoek Hotel in the Overberg Region from Saturday 19 – Monday, 21 March 2022. Launched in 2009, the THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN is synonymous with magnificent trails, spectacular views, mouth-watering food, a relaxed atmosphere, great vibe and most importantly, teamwork! Teams of two trail running enthusiasts (male/female/mixed) will be seen battling it out on a route varying in distances each day. Each stage will feature a different route that is guaranteed to keep things challenging, yet exciting, while leaving runners in awe. One of the many highlights of this iconic trail running celebration is “Dress Up Day” which will be celebrated on the third and final stage, on Monday 21 March. “This year Dress Up Day will once again take place on the final stage, Stage Three, on the Monday,” says Michael Meyer, Managing Director of Stillwater Sports and Founder of the THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN. “The rule is simple, we are looking for commitment and flair, and both runners need to wear their outfits for the duration of the stage, from start to finish. There are awesome sponsor prizes up for grabs as well as bragging rights.”
