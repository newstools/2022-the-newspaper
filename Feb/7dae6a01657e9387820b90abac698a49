Experience Stellenbosch in all its good-living glory during the town’s annual Street Soirées, a series of relaxed food-and-wine tastings underway from the end of this month. The popular events have become a calendar highlight as the perfect way to see in the new year and enjoy balmy evenings in South Africa’s premier cultural destination. The Street Soirées are presented by Stellenbosch Wine Routes and feature an array of participating restaurants and wineries. This is the opportunity to taste a variety of Stellenbosch wines and sumptuous street-food in a social, open-air setting. For the occasion, one of the town’s main roads is closed off, allowing visitors to snack and sip through fine local fare. Drostdy Street is also one of the historic town’s oldest and most scenic, which has made the event even more memorable. So too the gathering itself. For many of its loyal fans, Stellenbosch Street Soirées have become a way to re-connect with friends after the holiday season. But don’t just plan to go to one! Each Soirée features different wineries, giving you the chance to experience more than a few, and to keep the good vibes going. The 2022 Stellenbosch Street Soirées will take place on February 9 and 23, and March 9 and 23. For more information visit www.wineroute.co.za
