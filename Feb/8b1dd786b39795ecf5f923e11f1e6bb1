The 9th edition of the Investec Cape Town Art Fair will take place between 18-20 February 2022 at the Cape Town International Convention (CTICC). Cape Town Art Fair offers an intimate experience of the largest contemporary art fair in Africa, in one of the world’s most vibrant art cities – the place where the fast-growing African art market and the international art world meet. Investec Cape Town Art Fair’s focus for its ninth edition is shared-support, collaboration, and inspiring new initiatives to ensure momentum and establish a support system among exhibitors. “We believe in the art fair model to bring people together to connect, converse and contemplate at the forefront of contemporary art.” The 2022 edition of the fair looks profoundly to the notion of collaboration across aspects of Investec Cape Town Art Fair intending to open up a dialogue and a shared support structure, with an exchange of ideas, research, artists, strategies and resources. The SOLO section will feature works by several emerging and established artists from around the world. This section offers a more in-depth view of varied artistic practices from a wide cross-section of contexts – in the form of curated solo presentations.
In its fourth iteration, SOLO will explore how artists have reacted to intimacy and introspection caused by the pandemic, as well as the effect of exchange and collaboration on artistic practice.
