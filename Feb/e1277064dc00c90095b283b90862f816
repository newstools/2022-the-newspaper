Have you ever delayed on getting something done and all of a sudden, the price has gone up? With the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has been turned upside down. The knock-on effect of COVID-19 in the construction industry has been tough on every sector, especially on importing of raw materials. This has made RubberRoofs™ Liquid Rubber Paint™ production more difficult and subsequently an increase of 15% on raw materials. This is just the beginning, seeing that there is a big shortage of these materials worldwide. It will cause an increase in prices even more. So, if waterproofing your roof has been something you’ve been wanting to do, THE TIME IS NOW! WATERPROOF BEFORE THE RAIN COMES With the Western Cape recording record rains last winter, it is quite evident that climate change is in full swing and our seasons are very unpredictable.
