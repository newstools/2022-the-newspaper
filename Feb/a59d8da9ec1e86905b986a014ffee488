The hugely successful Helderberg Manor Retirement Village in Somerset West, a prestigious collection of houses, assisted living suites and garden apartments has launched a new block of assisted living suites, sold on a life right basis, which will be the last development on the estate. The newly launched suites will offer only 50 units, consisting of one bedroom, one bathroom suites selling from R995 000. The block will be completed by the end of April 2022. Developed by the esteemed Devmark Property Group, the development is situated in Heritage Park – a 200 hectare private estate, complete with its own houses, schools, shops, places of worship, parks and waterways at the foot of the picturesque Helderberg Mountain.
According to Dejane Ehlers, Head of Marketing at Devmark Property Group, the success of Helderberg Manor lies in the fact that it offers retirees everything they need. “We all know that location is of paramount importance. Helderberg Manor is situated close to the beautiful winelands of Somerset West and Stellenbosch, beaches, shops and restaurants. Furthermore, all the amenities have been completed including the clubhouse, library, assisted living suites and 24-hour medical care – all situated in beautifully landscaped gardens. “It remains one of our most successful developments to date. Our residents are active, social and enjoy life to the fullest, and our garden and house cleaning services give residents the opportunity to lead a lock-up and go lifestyle.” Steyl concludes: “The fact that most facilities have been completed at Helderberg Manor makes these apartments very attractive to prospective buyers. One can just move in and have the pleasure of all the required amenities on your doorstep in an established community.” For more information, visit www.helderbergmanor.co.za or contact Estelle Wilshere on 076 738 017
