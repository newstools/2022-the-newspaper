The Table Mountain Aerial Cableway Company (TMACC) will partner with The Galileo Open Air Cinema for the month of February to continue supporting tourism revival in Cape Town. The partnership falls under TMACC’s 12 month #CablewayLovesLocal campaign, which incentivizes local tourism activity. The #CablewayLovesLocal campaign kicked off in September 2021 through collaborating with travel and tourism businesses across Cape Town. Since the start of the campaign, TMACC has partnered with brands such as Coco Safar, the Sky-Hi ride and Groot Constantia wine farm. This February, TMACC and The Galileo Open Air Cinema offer a packed deal for patrons which includes two return cableway tickets with two complimentary drinks and two Warm and Comfy Galileo Open Air Cinema tickets with two Combo coupons which includes two popcorns, two Smarties and two fruit pastilles.
