Stellenbosch University students adding to the varsity town’s hustle and bustle with their lively conversations and teasing laughter are happy to be back on campus. Particularly those, it seems, who have grasped the opportunity to test their independence in an environment geared to support them as they learn, grow and thrive. That’s the finding of a ‘spot survey’ by Pam Golding Properties’ Stellenbosch office of several of the first young adults on campus to settle down in hostels, apartments, or ‘digs’ ahead of 2022 classes resuming. An attraction highlighted was the benefits of being within walking or cycling distance of the university’s facilities, as well as the face-to-face academic support. As a result of this desire to live on or close to campus, there has been no let-up in the demand for student accommodation in Stellenbosch. Da Vinci, Deo Gloria, 17 on Cluver and Archimedes are student-only developments taking every aspect of a student’s lifestyle into account and because they are semi-furnished, they ensure hassle-free accommodation from the outset. Deo Gloria comprises studios, lofts and two or three-bedroom apartments situated on the Green Route on Cluver and Merriman Roads, near the campus and patrolled by security guards on foot and bicycles. Another development, 17 on Cluver also enjoys beautiful Stellenbosch views and a natural ambiance from its sought-after position on the Green Route. Archimedes is situated opposite the university’s world-renowned Engineering Faculty and comprises a studio and two-bedroom with comprehensive security systems and green structures in place, it offers a secure, eco-friendly lifestyle. Other developments marketed by Pam Golding Properties include Bosmans Club and The Niche, which are not student-only buildings, but include apartments with more than two bedrooms, making them ideal for students’ parents to use when visiting.
