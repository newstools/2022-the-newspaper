From its lush, secluded garden that begs for picnickers, to its Edwardian architectural grandeur, to the astonishing, vibrant interior brimming with cultural and historical artefacts from far-flung travels, to one of the world’s most impressive collections of South African expressionist art, the Irma Stern Museum is nothing short of a national treasure. If it’s not yet on your bucket list, add this Rosebank, Cape Town destination to your must-see line-up of things to do! In 2022, this cultural gem celebrates its 50th year with a stimulating schedule of star-studded exhibitions, events and talks. Once the home of one of South Africa’s best known and internationally renowned painters, the Irma Stern Museum has been perfectly preserved just as the flamboyant artist left it. Even if her resplendent paintings – some of the most famous in the country and commanding the highest ever prices on auction – don’t intrigue you, the house itself warrants a visit just for a voyeuristic glance into how this larger-than-life personality lived a bold and unapologetic life dictated entirely by her own tastes. She collected Roman, Pre-Columbian American and Eastern pieces, which are displayed alongside furniture from Medieval and Renaissance Europe. The Rosebank museum abounds with unusual keepsakes from Irma’s landmark journeys from Cape Town into various parts of Africa, travels which so impacted on the subject of her paintings. For its 50th anniversary, the museum is welcoming its diverse local audiences to enjoy all that the property already has to offer, but there is also a special programme of events throughout the year. The first exhibition, by internationally recognised contemporary artist Athi Patra Ruga, runs from 19 March to 18 June 2022.
