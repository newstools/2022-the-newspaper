Grab your calendar and save the date as Knysna welcomes back one of the highlights on the South African festival calendar. The Knysna Oyster Festival will once again offer visitors an exciting array of events to partake in from 1- 10 July 2022. The programme includes the ever-popular Knysna Forest Marathon and Half Marathon and the two-day Knysna Cycle Tour with two days of MTB rides for all fitness levels. Trail runners have no less than four trail running events to compete in, including the popular Featherbed and Houtkapper Trail runs, and there are soccer, netball, rugby, boxing, and basketball matches. A long-time favourite on the programme, the 37th Knysna Forest Marathon and Half Marathon, will take place on 9 July 2022. For those that prefer “exercise” of a different kind, the Knysna Wine Festival will be back, and of course, the Knysna oyster will once again have the main stage. Wild oysters are harvested from the coastline around Knysna and will be served in a variety of ways – raw, cooked or steamed – delectable concoctions or plain with a dash of lemon. The natural paradise and picturesque town of Knysna was recently ranked #19 on the list; Leading Places: The 100 Most Loved Destinations Around the World for 2021. Undeniably the jewel of the Garden Route nestled on the banks of a breathtakingly beautiful lagoon, the town is looking forward to showing off its tranquil natural assets and welcoming sports enthusiasts, families, food, and wine lovers, as well as adrenalin junkies from all over South Africa for a one-of-a-kind winter holiday fun.
