Winter means whale season in South Africa as humpback, Bryde’s whales and southern right whales migrate from the Antarctic waters to our coasts to breed between June and December. Join in the second festive Welcome Whales Celebration hosted by a collaboration of whale enthusiasts, scientists and locals from 24 – 26 June 2022 in the New Harbour, Hermanus.
The three-day event will be held in the newly renovated multi-purpose centre in the New Harbour with great discounts on whale watching and other ocean related activities. A programme of fascinating talks, exhibitions, art and activities will showcase diverse marine life of Hermanus, honour the whales and celebrate the ocean. Everyone is invited to kick off the programme by participating in the Welcome Whales Wave, a fun cliff-top event which starts the festivities on Friday, 24 June at Gearing’s Point.
Among the highlights of the programme are a talk by Dr Els Vermeulen of the Mammal Research Institute’s Whale Unit covering recent research of the whales in Walker Bay and beyond; and a talk by explorer extraordinaire, Riaan Manser, on his death-defying oceanic adventures crossing the Atlantic from Africa to the USA, the Pacific from San Francisco to Hawaii, and circumnavigating both Iceland and Madagascar. Photographers have an opportunity to take their photography to exciting new places in an interactive demonstration of the latest compact, lightweight, travel-ready, weather sealed system with Olympus, The Photo Shed, The Photowalkers and Olympus ambassador Peter Hassall.
