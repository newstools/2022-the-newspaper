The streets of Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban will be buzzing with pink excitement on National Women’s Day (Tuesday, 9 August 2022) when thousands of runners and walkers show solidarity by being part of SA’s largest Women’s Day celebration, the Totalsports Women’s Race supporting the PinkDrive. PinkDrive is a Non-Profit Company (NPC) that is committed to improving breast cancer awareness, on the importance of self-breast examinations, and offering free breast health services to the medically uninsured across South Africa. “The Totalsports Women’s Race is an amazing initiative that celebrates women in a fun and interactive way,” says Tenielle Karen, PinkDrive Western Cape Marketing and Events Co-Ordinator. “The opportunity to be the official charity of the Totalsports Women’s Race will assist us with resources in mobilising our Cancer Screening Services and offering medical assistance to men and women who are not medically insured.” “Our message to entrants is to never give up, especially when fighting for what you believe in. Choose life and walk in Hope daily.”
