As the world reopens to travel, tourism, renewal and new opportunities, the South African wine industry is readying itself to open its doors to welcoming wine industry fraternity from across the globe as they prepare for their showcase event, CapeWine. The show will be held over 3 days from 5 – 7 October 2022 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC). For the third consecutive time, DHL Express have committed themselves to the South African wine industry to position themselves as a name partner and recognise the shared values that feed into this year’s theme: Sustainability 360. The ‘Sustainability 360’ theme ties into the overarching focus of the wider South African wine industry and the aim is to roll this out by impressing the importance of three pillars: Place, People and Prosperity. These pillars are what makes for a successful and sustainable industry both now and well into the future for generations to come, and each element of CapeWine will speak to this.As the world reopens to travel, tourism, renewal and new opportunities, the South African wine industry is readying itself to open its doors to welcoming wine industry fraternity from across the globe as they prepare for their showcase event, CapeWine.
