The feeling of adventure is the rush you feel when your plane touches down in an unfamiliar territory. It’s the light-headed elation of choosing to push beyond your boundaries to try something entirely new. An adventure is an exciting experience that is typically bold, and sometimes risky. Adventure is having the confidence to explore yourself – having the confidence to be brave, not to be afraid of anything. It helps you feel better on the inside and outside, while providing you with tons of new experiences. You’ll gain new skills and knowledge, which you can put to good use later on in life. You don’t have to fly halfway across the world to have an adventure. The Western Cape is the perfect place boasting a diverse topography and natural beauty to experience the great outdoors with endless adventures including paraglyding, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting or extreme sports. So, don’t wait any longer, go out and experience your next adventure! “Life is either a great adventure, or nothing at all,” Helen Keller once said.
