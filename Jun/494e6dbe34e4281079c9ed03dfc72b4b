Upcoming Decorex Cape Town can’t be defined by a mere list of reasons to visit! Trying to reduce over 250+ leading brands, stimulating speakers, inaugural product appearances, new collection launches, exhibitions and bespoke features into a handy listicle is to diminish the relevance and impact of this powerhouse of African design. The reimagined Decorex Africa is positioned to move the industry into new territories of collaboration, inspiration and innovation. “Because we couldn’t possibly cover all of it, here’s a small sampling of why you should head to the CTICC from 16 – 19 June 2022.” Key Show Features and Activities: The Best Bar in the City (A gathering place for networking), Almost too good to eat! (Njano Eatery, the foodie hub at the heart of the show), Host with the most (New Design Summit talks), State of the Industry Report 2022, 100% (new showcase of original pieces, providing a sterling opportunity for designers to really show their thinking), 100% Transparency (showcase of the power of transparency in design from both a figurative and literal perspective), and 100 Flavours (Culinary designer Hannerie Visser of Studio H will present a contemplation on the edible in a beautifully mounted display).
