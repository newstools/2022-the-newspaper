From 2022, the George Mountain Ultra Trail will once again be known as the Discovery George MUT. And as in-person events make a much-awaited comeback, Discovery has re-established its support for the trail run and affiliated events in the Garden Route. The 2022 Discovery George MUT is scheduled to take place on 18 June 2022. Along with the new 100-kilometre race distance the Discovery George MUT will also introduce a 5-kilometre family fun run, as well as re-introduce the MUT Life Festival around the event. A celebration of all things trail running, the MUT Life Festival will kick off on Wednesday, 15 June, with a screening of selected Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival (VIMFF) movies. The next day, is the Youth Day public holiday and as such is scheduled to host the MUT VK Challenge, from the Ground Zero Bike Park to the summit of George Peak. Later on, Thursday, visiting trail runners are invited to attend the George Trail Running club’s weekly time trial. Having staged three editions of the event with a flagship 60-kilometre distance the 2022 race will now boast an exceptionally challenging 100-kilometre route too. The new route will feature 4 500 metres of climbing and will be up there with the toughest 100-kilometre races globally. “Yet, it will still feature our signature hospitality and generous 24-hour cut-off to allow as many runners to complete the race as possible.” The race will be added to the Vitality Race Calendar and points for the trail run will be awarded to Vitality members.
