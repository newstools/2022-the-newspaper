Abalone is quite difficult to find, even in Hermanus – not any more. A quaint little restaurant situated on the water’s edge of the Old Harbour in Hermanus, specialising in perlemoen dishes, opened its doors last month. Back in the day, one of the historic buildings in the Old Harbour, now home to Perlemoen was an abalone hatchery and thereafter housed the Hermanus Shore Angling Club. It took the owners, Jannie and Annabella Malherbe a few months to renovate and transform this rundown historic building into the cosy 30-seater restaurant it is today. “The old harbour was really in need of something to bring people back down into the beautiful historic harbour, and we hope combining something very Hermanus, like ‘Abalone” with the history – creating something unique and special. We are mostly focussed on seafood and especially abalone that we source live from an abalone farm in Hermanus. Our vision is to create something unique for our customers – an authentic South African experience,” says Jannie. Visit Perlemoen for a bite to eat, relax, and enjoy the beautiful panoramic views, while watching the whales frolicking in Walker Bay. Perlemoen is open on Tuesday – Sunday from 9:30 am – 4pm For more information contact 082 841 3547
