The Western Cape Blood Service (WCBS) has struggled in recent weeks to maintain the necessary blood stock levels. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for blood to perform transfusions within the healthcare system. The Western Cape Blood Service is a non-profit, independent organisation operating throughout the Western Cape. They work without prejudice to supply safe blood and blood products to all communities in the region, from Cape Town all the way up to George. It’s their goal to be the benchmark transfusion service in South Africa. By donating blood, you could save up to three people’s lives. The blood you donate today, can help people who have suffered severe and traumatic injuries, childbirth, surgery, suffer from anaemia or have blood disorders, as well as people who are receiving treatment for cancer. According to the WCBS, there is a critical shortage in blood groups, O, B and A. So please, do not delay – and help save a life in the Western Cape by donating blood. WCBS have 5 permanent blood donation centres in Cape Town (N1 City Mall, Blue Route Mall, 9 Long Street, Cape Town CBD, Cape Gate and Kenilworth Centre) and 3 regional branches (Worcester, George, Paarl). Download the latest version of the WCBS App on the App Store or Google Play. Features include: Save blood drive events to your phone’s calendar to remind you to donate blood, a personalised profile with your blood donor details and when last you donated, and updates on blood stocks.
