South Africa is fortunate to have a temperate climate with a relatively mild winter in comparison to the extremely hot summer months when temperatures and humidity soar. The cooler winter months make it a preferable time to go on safari and visit game parks and reserves. This is because wild animals tend to venture forth from the shaded shelter of trees and bushes during the daytime and come out into the open to forage, making them more visible and easier to spot. Winter is thus a time that many South Africans associate with being out in the wild, and being close to nature, where the expansiveness of the great outdoors is driven home. This is why Plascon’s 2022 Winter colour palette takes its cue from earthy, wide-open spaces, our verdant land with its fertile soil, and those dramatic skies and sunsets you only see when you’re away from the city. Plascon’s new winter “Grounded” palette features a bouquet of earth-inspired colours that bring our famed bushveld and savannah landscapes directly to mind.
Deep khaki green and a rich reddish brown are the stronger colours of this down-to-earth collection. The rich and complex earthen Plascon Terra Nova (R6-D1-2) is matched in depth and saturation by the verdant green of Plascon Garden Seat (G1-E1-1). For gentle balance, Plascon has added a harmonious trio of natural yellows. From the warm white of Plascon Moon Beam (Y5-A2-3), to soft Pear Fantasy (Y5-B2-1), and golden Plascon Desert Daisy (Y3-B1-2), you use these natural hues together to bring a mood of grounded calm to your spaces.
