A special treat is in store for Capetonians, as the much-loved story of Peter Pan will be recreated on stage at the Canal Walk Winter Theatre taking place between 25 June – 17 July 2022. In this 2022 magical musical adaption of JM Barrie’s adored classic tale, Peter, Tinkerbell, and Wendy Darling, along with the incorrigible Captain Hook and his faithful sidekick, Smee, will ferry audiences to Never Land to be amazed by all its wonders, allowing imaginations to soar unfettered into the realms of storytelling and enchantment, as the battle between Peter and Captain Hook unfolds all around them. Audiences are also encouraged to dress up as part of the festivities. This is a great opportunity for budding pirates, fairies etc to get in on the act. Produced by Fred Abrahamse and Marcel Meyer, expect appearances from a series of Never Land characters that include, mysterious mermaids from Mermaid Lagoon; the beautiful Princess Tiger Lilly and her brave, Panther; the high-spirited Lost Boys and Hook’s band of pirates aboard the Jolly Roger and of course, the crocodile, whose taste for time pieces (clocks and watches) is now legendary. Also joining the cast will be a gathering of life-sized puppets, who add yet another fun dimension to this spectacular performance. A talented, star-studded cast, together with breathtaking sets, magnificent costumes, and several dashing musical numbers, will bring Peter Pan to life. Ticket available via Webtickets
