  On 06 June 2022 United Airlines officially expanded its service to Cape Town with three non-stop flights per week, year-round, between Cape Town International Airport and its New York hub, following their decision to resume their direct flights between Cape Town and Newark/New York, ahead of their initial schedule. The Boeing 787-9 aircraft was welcomed by a cheery crowd – a mixture of a waiting public, representatives from the Western Cape government & the City of Cape Town, representatives from ACSA and United Airlines, Wesgro’s Air Access team, United Airlines’ cabin crew, as well as the CTT Penguins – all joined in to celebrate the start of the year-round route. Supporting the economic recovery in the Western Cape and providing much-needed relief to the tourism and hospitality sector in the province, the New York/Newark – Cape Town route is expected to generate R523-million worth of direct tourism spend within its first year of operation (June 2022-May 2023). The United States has historically been Cape Town’s third largest international market, with two-way passenger volumes between the United States and Cape Town equalling 213 000 passengers in 2019. In addition: Western Cape Minister of Finance and Economic Opportunities, Mireille Wenger, commented: “The expansion of the current service by United Airlines, from seasonal flights to an all-year-round service which includes three flights per week direct from New York/Newark-Cape Town, is more great news for the Western Cape. There is clearly a surge in demand for flights to Cape Town as a global travel destination. This points to signs of recovery and rebound in the tourism and hospitality sector. We are working on clearing obstacles so that we can increase connections to the Western Cape, which will bring a host of positive contributions to the economy and job creation. At the end of the day, more flights mean more tourists, and more tourists mean more jobs in the Western Cape.”
