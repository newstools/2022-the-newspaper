On 1 June 2022, Paul and Cathy du Toit handed the keys of this winelands institution to the new owner, Jean-Pierre Rossouw. In 1998, Paul and Cathy du Toit established what has become an iconic home for fine South African wine. Now, 24 years later, Wine Village Hermanus is still one of the largest privately-owned specialist wine shops in the world. Showcasing more than 4,000 fine wines and spirits, all of which are proudly South African. In an interesting echo, Jean-Pierre Rossouw started his own wine career in 1999 as a weekly wine columnist.  Author of several wine titles, he was most recently the publisher of the international wine icon, the Platter’s South African Wine Guide. Jean-Pierre also founded the independent South African restaurant guide, Rossouw’s Restaurants. Now, with Wine Village Hermanus as his foundation and home, he looks forward to sharing his knowledge and love for telling the story of South Africa through grower to vine to wine. Says Jean-Pierre: “It feels like the past 23 years have been training me for this… As the culmination of my wine journey, heading up Wine Village Hermanus is a great honour. I relish this incredible opportunity to take this fine wine retailer into its next decades. Wine Village is a true icon and I thank Paul and Cathy for entrusting it to me. I know an exciting future awaits!” Paul du Toit adds: “We have known Jean-Pierre for over 10 years and his knowledge, love for the industry and interpersonal relationships make him the perfect person to expand the company’s global vision, and keep the legacy that is Wine Village Hermanus strong. Cathy and I are delighted that our Wine Village has Jean-Pierre as its next custodian, and we wish him and the team all the very best.” Join us every day for a fine wine time with Jean-Pierre, and the whole Wine Village Team.
