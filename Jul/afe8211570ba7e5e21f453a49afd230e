On 13 July, Cape Town’s iconic Groot Constantia Estate celebrates its 337th birthday, cementing its status as the oldest wine-producing farm in South Africa. Adding to the Estate’s reputation of consistent quality is its much-lauded flagship wine, Grand Constance, which recently received the National Wine Challenge Special Award for Wine Consistency and the Grand Cru ‘Best in Class’ Award. Groot Constantia’s world-famous wine continues to shine as it claims the spot with one of three wines in South Africa which have achieved more than seven top 100 positions annually, with Grand Constance leading the charge with 11 wins over a period of 12 years. Until now, Grand Constance undeniably remains the grand dame of sweet wines. Hundreds of years ago, the wine produced at Groot Constantia began to receive international acclaim for its superior quality, and emperors and kings – such as Frederick the Great of Prussia, Napoleon and Louis Philippe, King of the French – were all known to be great lovers of Groot Constancia wines (translated Grand Constance into the French) which also means “consistency”. As a provincial heritage site and a living museum, Groot Constantia has always been one of Cape Town’s most important destinations and is a member of the Cape Town Big 6 tourist attractions. Groot Constantia has been welcoming visitors to the Estate for more than 300 years and has a long track record as a must-visit location in the Cape. In fact, 160 years ago, JP Cloete (the then owner of Groot Constantia), produced one of the earliest known tourist attraction adverts in South Africa, marketing Groot Constantia and giving detailed directions to the Estate – making it the first-ever wine route map in SA. For the modern-day visitor – be it wine lovers, fun-seeking families, tourists, social explorers, or anyone looking for a memorable and unique location in the Cape – Groot Constantia offers a wonderful day out, immersed in a rich sense of history and wine culture, accompanied by gorgeous views and outdoor spaces, exceptional wines, delicious food and fun for the whole family.
