The Bo-Kaap is a community with a uniquely rich history and culture and one of the most visited areas in the city. You can find the best koesisters, sweet treats and Cape Malay food in the Bo Kaap too. Many restaurants, vendors and traders are doing their best to recover from the impact of the pandemic. To ensure they get through this, and thrive again, support local businesses and enjoy what’s on offer within their communities. Within the rich cultural history of the Bo-Kaap precinct is the Iziko Bo-Kaap Museum (IBKM), one of the earliest homes built in the Bo-Kaap area, dating back to the mid-eighteenth century. The Museum was established in 1978 as a satellite location of the SA Cultural History Museum. It was furnished as a house that depicts the lifestyle of a nineteenth-century Muslim family.
