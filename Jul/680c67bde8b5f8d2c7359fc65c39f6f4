“OK, kids, we’re off wine tasting.” Much eye-rolling, followed by one word uttered in unison. “Boring!” Now rewind. “Guys, the grown-ups are planning a wine tasting at Nederburg. We’ve planned something very similar for you. You’ll be able to taste different flavoured chocolate milk drinks paired with a selection of cookies. You get to sip and nibble and compare and decide which combo’s the nicest. What do you think?” “Yay, can we go there now?” they ask. Jerry Kennedy of Nederburg’s The Manor eatery says, “We understand that children need fun activities of their own. So apart from the milk and cookie pairings, we offer cupcake decoration workshops, we arrange picnic boxes with a delicious collection of snacks you’d be happy to see them eating and drinking.” Jerry says the accent this winter is on indoor activities, but weather permitting, “We set the picnics up on the beautiful rolling lawns, under the shade of the plane trees or on our stoep and keep a close eye on everyone.” There’s also Jenga and a range of lawn games, jungle gyms and a zip-line, tree house, swings and more to keep the children occupied.
