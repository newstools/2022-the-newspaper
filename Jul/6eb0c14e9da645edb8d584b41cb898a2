Escaping to nature is a wonderful way to reset, and there’s certainly no better way to spend your day, weekend or holiday, enjoying a safari getaway in the Western Cape. There are numerous game reserves in the Western Cape that offer the perfect backdrop for a wildlife encounter, all easily accessible and in malaria-free regions – some can be reached by car in a couple of hours. If you are a safari newbie, welcome to this magical world – it is an enticing, relaxing, exhilarating and sometimes an overwhelming experience. All your senses will be awakened by the sights, sounds and experiences you will have when going on a safari. The Winter months of June to October offer the best game viewing when the herds of game graze during the day, whilst watering holes and riverbeds are the main attraction at sunset.
Other activities during a safari can include game drives, birdwatching, guided walks, boating and many more. The Big 5 game reserves in the Western Cape where you can view lions, leopards, elephants, rhinoceros and buffalo are: Gondwana Game Reserve, Sanbona Wildlife Reserve, Garden Route Game Lodge, Inverdoorn Game Reserve, and Aquila Game Reserve.
