What better excuse to stock up on wines for the winter season? Franschhoek is Celebrating Bastille after a two-year hiatus on 16 – 17 July, taking place in the main road of Franschhoek, with all things French inspired. Dress up in your finest red, white and blue, not forgetting your beret, as you soak all that Franschhoek has to offer – great wines, delicious food and superb hospitality. The village’s Main Road will be abuzz with activities, which include French-inspired street food offerings from the restaurants situated along the way. Grab a freshly baked croissant, filled baguettes, croque monsieur, moules frites or a piping hot cinnamon sugar pancake as you take in the day’s festivities. Channel your inner Marie Antoinette or Charles de Gaulle for the day by hiring a costume. Franschhoek’s local band will add to the festive vibe throughout the weekend at the Town Hall.
