La Paris Boutique Hotel is here for you! This enviable setting, just outside the historic town of Franschhoek, offers something for everyone and is the ideal luxurious base to explore the Cape Winelands. Experience the tranquillity of the outdoors by enjoying the extensive, beautiful gardens and dam, playing a game of tennis, catching some sun and cooling down with a dip in the pool. Book a lawn picnic with exquisite views, or relax with pre-arranged in room massages and treatments. The area boasts some of the best wineries as well as activities including golf at Pearl Valley (among the top 5 golf courses in SA), horse riding, quad biking and more. If you like to get involved in the kitchen, or you simply want to learn something new, book a private interactive masterclass to refine your cooking and baking skills, or if you just want to sit back and relax, the High Tea is definitely an experience to write home about. La Paris Bakery and Deli bakes fresh breads, sweet treats and offers light bites that can be enjoyed in our deli or herb garden. La Paris Bistro serves a decadent breakfast and lunch under the huge oak trees or inside the gorgeous restaurant. For dinner, you can expect stylish table settings, white tablecloths, gold cutlery, fresh flowers and of course beautifully plated dishes followed by a nightcap in the Manor House. The La Paris Family are excited to welcome you to your home from home and to help you make memories. For more information contact 021 867 0171, email hotel@lapris.co.za or visit www.lapris.co.za
