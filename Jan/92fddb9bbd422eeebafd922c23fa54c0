Nini Jerman – the entrepreneur behind the Winston & Julia chocolate brand – has opened an exciting new restaurant and activity hub located at Stellenbosch Vineyards. Called the Winston & Julia Chocolate Shop and Ceramic Café, the new establishment replaces the wine farm’s previous Bus Stop restaurant and is situated on an island on the Welmoed Farm’s duck pond. The refurbished venue has been divided into two sections: a pizza restaurant, complete with woodfired pizza oven, wicker lights and soft, relaxing décor and a chocolate workshop that offers chocolate slab-making and chocolate truffle-making parties as well as various pairings with rooibos tea, coffee, wine, pizza and chocolate. The old yellow Bedford bus, that has been an iconic feature of the island for many years, is still there and has been renovated and converted into the Splatter & Paint Bus, a fabulous venue for children’s parties. Pizza offerings have an artistic bent and diners can choose from the Pierneef (BBQ pulled pork, caramelised red wine onions, rocket and feta), the Tretchikoff (harissa chicken, parmesan, peppadews and mint yoghurt), the Sekoto (bacon, feta, avocado and sundried tomatoes) or the Battiss (bacon, fig, brie and rocket) among others. There are also various platters (cheese, charcuterie or pizza) to share and the aforementioned pairings which include a chocolate truffle and wine pairing, pizza and wine pairing, chocolate and rooibos tea pairing and an African coffee and chocolate pairing.
The Winston & Julia Chocolate Shop and Ceramic Café looks set to become a firm favourite with locals and tourists, a place where families can enjoy a great meal and indulge in something a little extra. The perfect destination for those looking to do something a little different these holidays.
