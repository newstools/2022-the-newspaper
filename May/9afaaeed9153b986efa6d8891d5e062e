Whether you’re an intrepid explorer or part of an active family, you’ll find no shortage of adventures to conquer in the Western Cape. If you’re not quite the ‘outdoors type,’ there are still plenty of ways to experience nature in your own time and at your own pace.
Day hikes you can add to your itinerary: Skeleton Gorge, Table Mountain – If you’d prefer to skip the crowds on Lion’s Head, Skeleton Gorge is arguably one of Table Mountain’s most scenic routes. At just 6,2 km, the first half of this moderate trail consists of forested ravines, the second half showcasing handsome views over the Mother City. La Motte Hiking Trail, Franschhoek – This circular route allows you to gaze over the mountains of the Franschhoek Valley and get some fresh Winelands air to the lungs.
Pipe Track, Cape Town – It’s one of the best hiking trails in Cape Town for beginners! Located on the Western slopes of Table Mountain, you’ll walk along a relatively flat path past views of Camps Bay, Clifton and the dramatic Twelve Apostles Mountain Range.
