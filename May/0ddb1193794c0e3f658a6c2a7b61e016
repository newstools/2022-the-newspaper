A thirty-year journey took a huge step forward with the grand opening of the new market leading Tack Shack retail location. From small beginnings, the mother and daughter team of Eve and Tanja have grown Tack Shack into the premier Equestrian store in the Western Cape. Having outgrown the long-standing shop in Durbanville, it was time for the next step with a bespoke building to perfectly match the needs of the business for the next exiting chapter. After more than a year of planning, building, and moving three different locations to the new premisses, it was time to share the new retail experience with the Equestrian folk of the Western Cape. The long wait was finally over on the 1st of April, and this was no April fools. From early morning the eager Equestrians thronged at the gate chomping at the bit to savour the new experience, great specials, and leading new product additions to the Tack Shack offering. And the day did not disappoint, “The opening was a huge success! I would like to thank all our customers for their continued support! We are looking forward to continuing this exiting journey, and we will be focusing on providing even more exiting local and international premium products at affordable prices for our customer to enjoy in our world-class store,” beamed Tanja. “Furthermore”, she continued, “with the newly extended trading through to 2pm on a Saturdays, we are excited to welcome all Equestrians that have not had a chance to visit to come and enjoy the new retails experience.” Tack Shack now manufactures all leather equestrian products as well as repairing saddles under the same roof as the retail space, allowing for an optimised customer experience.
It’s time to visit and enjoy this new experience of a premium one-stop shop for all your equestrian needs, your steed will thank you for it! For more information visit 41 Tanzanite Crescent, Stonewood Business Park, Kraaifontein, www.shop.tackshack.co.za or contact 021 976 8044
