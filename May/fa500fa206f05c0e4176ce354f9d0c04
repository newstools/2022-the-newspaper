Situated in the quaint village of Noordhoek, Jardim is a fairy tale destination for the whole family. The grounds were purchased by Angela and Justin Gomes in 2015, and the couple transformed it into an organic farm and source of nourishment for their family, staff and guests. Their home-grown veggie garden soon became the driving force behind their delicious fresh produce, and the farm and greenhouse have been transformed from repurposed elements found on the farm. From low-budget travellers to those interested in sustainable agriculture and authentic accommodation, it’s a perfect escape from the city, and a place to take the whole family. It’s no wonder thousands of students, working professionals, honeymooners and families visit the farm each year. Being able to meander through the grounds, pick your own fresh produce, and learn about the importance of sustainability is a truly unique offering. Tinashe, the head gardener on the farm, carefully curates a display of perfectly assorted picked produce that’s available for purchase by guests, collection by visitors, or delivery to homes. He is a masterful storyteller, and his passion and love for gardening radiate through him as he guides guests on tours of the grounds. The Jardim team is also behind many incredible community initiatives, including the Masi Creative Hub, through which they teach the residents of Masiphumelele how to grow their own food.
