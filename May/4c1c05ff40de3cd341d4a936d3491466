The new Mediclinic Vergelegen Day Clinic is now ready to bring accessible, efficient care to the Winelands community. It’s conveniently co-located alongside the main hospital, bringing its range of services into the fold of a high-quality spectrum of care. In addition, day clinics have limited waiting times. General surgeon Dr Riaan Beyers adds that patient satisfaction is the central focus. “Apart from the personalised environment at Mediclinic Vergelegen Day Clinic, it’s unique in that it’s attached to the main hospital.” Mediclinic Vergelegen Day Clinic has one theatre and offers general and orthopaedic surgery, plus gynaecology, urology, ENT, maxillofacial and dental procedures. All patients receive a high standard of quality care, clinically thorough protocols and streamlined systems that make their planned procedures simpler, faster and more accessible. These facilities accommodate a wide range of planned, relatively minor diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Patients are admitted and discharged on the same day, but the high standard of clinical care is the same as they’d receive at any Mediclinic facility.
