The Plant Powered Show takes place this year at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) from Friday, 27 May – Sunday, 29 May 2022. The plant-based food revolution is a fast growth industry and an exciting space for new and emerging businesses and start-ups. It will incorporate a not-to-be-missed three-day live in-person event as well as an exciting virtual component, which will allow visitors from other provinces and around the globe to attend online. The Plant Powered Show is the first of its kind in South Africa, bringing the plant-based, vegetarian, vegan and conscious living revolution to a mainstream audience. The hugely successful inaugural Plant-Powered Show (under the name The Festive Vegan & Plant Powered Show) took place online in 2020. Aimed at those looking to live and enjoy a healthier, more conscious and sustainable lifestyle with a smaller environmental footprint, The Plant Powered Show features professional chefs, celebrity cooks and rising stars presenting live cooking demos, diverse and compelling talks by the health and wellness experts, premium and interactive experiences, exclusive industry networking and a marketplace of plant-based food, drink and lifestyle products. Also joining the team as a consultant is Emma-Claire Peter who started off her culinary career in food styling, recipe development and writing before working as a restaurant and chefs’ theatre coordinator for TASTE festivals and then moving into food retail, working in Selfridges and Sourced Market in London. Peter, a trained chef, most recently produced Plant Forward Kitchen for Google Foods in partnership with the Culinary Institute of America, an experience that led to her adopting a vegan lifestyle.
