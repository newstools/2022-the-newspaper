Dis-Chem Pharmacies has launched Dis-Chem Health, a health insurance offering with premiums starting at R431 per month for the Core plan and increasing to R591 per month for the Plus plan with additional cover options available for accident and medical emergency illness cover. Child dependants start at R302 per month per child, while accident cover starts at R185 per month for adults and R100 per month for children. This follows last year’s acquisition of 25% of Kaelo Holdings’ equity which houses a complementary portfolio of health assets, including occupational health clinics, the AskNelson psychological wellbeing platform, and the administration of benefit-rich gap and primary health insurance products. Dis-Chem said it has identified a need to provide universal access to affordable and quality private primary healthcare in an environment where more people are prepared to pay for healthcare. It added that demand for affordable medical cover continues to grow in an environment impacted by continued financial pressure on consumers, this against a backdrop of fewer people being able to afford traditional medical aid cover, and the strained quality of, and access to, public health services. Nearly three-quarters (72%) of South Africans access the public health network, 15.2% have access to medical aid, and 11.8% pay for out-of-pocket private healthcare. Only 2% of South Africans are covered by medical insurance. Medical insurance offers members non-life insurance cover for the cost of day-to-day healthcare needs and certain accident and medical emergency illness events. Whilst it is not a medical scheme, does not offer the same benefits as a medical scheme and is not a substitute for a medical scheme, medical insurance is a good option for those who cannot afford medical aid membership.
