Originating in the Middle East, shawarma is a crowd-favourite known for its aromatic, tangy and warm flavours. Traditionally, shawarma is filled with pieces of lamb, chicken or beef, or a mix of these meats, and flavoured with garlic, lime and a range of spices, wrapped together in a large flatbread. The filling dish is often topped with tahini or hummus. When the hunger pangs strike, sometimes the only dish that will fix it is a delicious and flavour-packed shawarma. Cape Town is home to a few restaurants, delis, food stalls  offering shawarma. Nish Nush (City Bowl) is a casual dining spot in Bree Street that offers curbside outdoor seating from its “hummus hatch” and specialises in authentic Middle Eastern street food. Johnny Shawarma (Sea Point) – Located in the heart of bustling Sea Point, Johnny Shwarma is a vibrant dining spot offering shawarma in a pita and a deconstructed shawarma version in fresh salad bowls. The Falafel Guy (Sea Point) – Arguably one of Cape Town’s most-talked-about falafel spots, the Falafel Guy, located on the sunny and picturesque Sea Point Promenade, is a food stall that aims to offer authentic Middle Eastern dishes and flavours. Shawarma Express (Sea Point, Table View and Rondebosch) Shawarma Express is known for offering traditional Middle Eastern cuisine with both shawarma and falafel available. While the restaurant is well-known for its traditional shawarma and falafel offering, the menu also has a range of other options such as burgers and pizzas. Shawarma House (City Bowl) – Located along Long Street, Shawarma House offers a range of shawarma menu options with a twist – unlike traditional shawarmas, the ones on offer are available wrapped up in a roti, naan, the traditional pita or a wrap.
