Plett Tourism is proud to introduce the inaugural Plett Ocean Festival, inviting all interested parties to save the dates of 1 – 10 July 2022 to celebrate Plettenberg Bay’s most beloved treasures: the ocean, marine life, and beaches. The festival will be anchored by a three-day marine science symposium and a variety of ocean-themed events with a strong conservation theme. Plettenberg Bay has much to offer during winter including mild weather and abundant marine life. Attention during this time of the year is largely focused on the wonders of the ocean as the whales are in the bay, scuba diving and snorkelling conditions are often idyllic, and the resident seals, dolphins, sharks, and marine birds are attracted to plentiful food sources. Among many highlights of the upcoming festival, the Marine Science Symposium, from 1-3 July 2022 will be held at the oceanside Beacon Isle Resort over three days and presentations will cover topics ranging from marine life, ecological impact presentations and conservation projects by a selection of top scientists and biologists in their fields. The Plett Ocean Festival will also offer a variety of fun and family-friendly activities including rocky shore excursions, guided hikes, scuba diving and snorkelling, trail runs, surf lessons, angling competitions, a team surfing competition, and an oceanic art exhibition. Collaborations at the festival are many as Nature’s Valley Trust has partnered with Open Plan Pictures to screen the animated movie, Seal Team alongside an educational talk on pollution and marine debris; Adopt-A-Swimmer and the Black Mermaid Foundation have partnered to introduce youngsters to the wonders beneath the waves, and the local NSRI Station 14 will hold an open day for visitors to tour the station and learn more about National Sea Rescue Institute and its work. As a town with six international Blue Flag Beaches and two Blue Flag Boats, a Mission Blue Hope Spot, and surrounded by both national parks and marine protected areas, the Plett Ocean Festival aims to be an all-inclusive, one-of-a-kind event that celebrates conserving and sustainably enjoying our marine resources: beaches, shoreline and the deep blue sea.
