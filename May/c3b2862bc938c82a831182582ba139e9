Con Spirito Philharmonic presents a Night at the Opera on Saturday, 21 May, 19h30, at the DRC Uitsig, Ridgeworth. You will be treated to wonderful arias, duets, and ensembles from famous operas with full orchestra and choir. Some of these are the “Habanera” and Gypsy Song from Bizet’s Carmen and the famous duet from Pearl Fishers, “Dove sono” and “Se vuol ballare” from Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro, “Nessun Dorma” from Puccini’s Turandot, the lovely quartet, “Bella figlia dell’amore” from Rigoletto, and the rousing “Brindisi” from La Traviata. The Con Spirito Philharmonic will, among others, sing the well-known slave chorus, “Va, pensiero” from Verdi’s Nabucco.
