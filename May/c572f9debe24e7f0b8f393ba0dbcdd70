Sea Point’s bustling Regent Road is now home to a new local favourite, Kanela Café. The look and feel of the café is rooted within an earthy feel, something that is accented by the indoor seating décor. Offering ample seating outdoors in a dreamy courtyard setting centred around a large stone water fountain, the outdoor ambience puts one in a holiday mood instantly, and it is hard to imagine this spot is on a busy main road as the noise does not filter into the seating area. With a long list of plant-based offerings, the menu sticks to wholesome basics such as smoothie bowls, hot breakfast options, light lunches and decadent (but healthy) sweet treats. A variety of light and filling dishes are available, and the quality of food paired with its affordable pricing offer real value to customers. With a strong focus on offering plant-based and meat-free dishes, the café continues its theme of sustainable offerings even with its coffee. A fresh cuppa from Kanela Café is made from coffee grown in the Democratic Republic of Congo, processed and roasted in Uganda.
Tea-lovers will be overjoyed to know that the café offers an extensive list of teas, from the regular rooibos to the speciality ginseng oolong tea.
