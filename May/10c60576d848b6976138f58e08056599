Visitors are welcome to come and watch the South African National Figure Skating competition taking place on Monday, 9 May and Tuesday, 10 May at the Ice Station at GrandWest. All eligible skaters were invited to take part in the South African National Figure Skating Championships 2022 by the Western Province Figure Skating Association and the South African Figure Skating Association (SAFSA). Figure Skating in the Western Province “As the largest skating community in the country, we are fortunate to be able to offer Free Skating (solo), Pairs Skating, Ice-Dance and Synchronised Skating as well as a robust “Learn to Skate” program. Full-time coaches as well as dedicated ice time help our skaters achieve high levels of competitiveness, with many of our skaters representing Western Province at a National level, and some of these representing South Africa on the international circuit.” Figure skating is a complex sport, both technically (on the ice) and understanding how a skater progresses through the ranks. SAFSA (WP) has recently introduced an induction program for new members, giving skaters and parents vital information and points of reference to help smooth this process. Spectators can look forward to seeing incredibly talented skaters competing across a number of categories such as singles, pairs and synchronised skating teams. Tickets are R90 per person and payable at the door. Tickets are R50 each for pensioners and children under 10 years of age. For more information visit www.wpfigureskating.co.za
