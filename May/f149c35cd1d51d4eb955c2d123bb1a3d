Back in the 1930s, the world descended into The Great Depression. It was a time of great hardship, doom, and gloom, and it was the ‘Big Top’ travelling circus that buoyed people’s spirits. The circus was a source of escapism, affordable family entertainment, and brought much-needed joy. Fast-forward to 2021 and history repeats, as the world recovers from another pandemic and subsequent global depression. Reflective of the 30s, may the magic of the circus yet again provide the antidote for gloomy times. Slapstick is a traditional circus show with an invigorating 1930s twist, peppered with side-splitting comedy. This fun-filled, family show will transport audiences back to the era of Swing, Gypsy Jazz, The Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin. A celebration of the origination of Slapstick comedy, when ‘a pie in the face’ was popularized and exuberant colours were high fashion. Slapstick will take you on a nostalgic trip down memory lane, leave you in awe with breathtaking aerial displays, roaring with laughter at the comedic acrobatics and allow you to pack up your troubles. Slapstick will be performed by the super-talented youth from the Zapper’s Programme. The Dome will be transformed into a theatrical circus picnic site. Just bring your picnic blankets and cushions. Picnic spaces will be allocated on a first come, first served basis, you can buy your yummy savoury picnic feast from Dish Food & Social. Information: Dates: 21-22 May, 28-29 May – Zip Zap Circus School Dome For more information visit www.zip-zap.co.za
