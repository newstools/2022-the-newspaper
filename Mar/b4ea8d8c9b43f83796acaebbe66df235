The Events Permit Office  has issued 191 event permits between July and December of the 2021/22 financial year. This is in stark contrast to the 2020/21 financial year, when the office only issued 91 event permits. The low numbers in the previous financial year can be attributed to the national state of disaster restrictions on gatherings, which also forced the cancellation of many events.
“The increase in the number of permits is a great indication that the event’s industry is steadily recovering from the pandemic that has caused devastation to jobs and the economy. During this financial year, we have hosted major events such as the Cape Town Cycle Tour, SANLAM Cape Town Marathon and Miss South Africa, among others,” said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, Alderman JP Smith.
The Events Permit Office has also issued 30 non-compliance letters, with 25 in the last three months. For an event permit approval, it is important that event organisers produce: Detailed medical plans or confirmation from a medical service provider to undertake this work; Detailed security plans; Vendor layout plan and certificates of acceptability for food vendor, Emergency evacuation plans, Confirmation of an appropriate public liability insurance and a SAPS Risk Grading Certificate.
