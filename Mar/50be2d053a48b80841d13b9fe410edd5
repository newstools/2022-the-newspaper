Yes, it’s official. The popular Kirstenbosch Summer Sunset Concerts return to the Garden with a two-show only, limited ticket line-up. Pop/RnB artist c will be performing on 20 March, while modern folk singer-songwriter Jeremy Loops performs a week later on 27 March. Cape Town-born, Jimmy Nevis began dominating the SA music charts at the tender age of 19 with his smash hit Elephant Shoes. After racking up a slew of No.1 singles, such as Heartboxing, 7764, All About It, Balloon and Hey Jimmy, he is now a household name. His electric live performances never disappoint concert-goers of all ages – and he’s literally ‘stolen the stages’ of some of the biggest festivals and events in sub-Saharan Africa. This year, he celebrates his super-successful 10th anniversary of being a South African muso. Multiple music award-winner Jeremy Loops built a cult-following off the power of his live shows, selling out in London and around the world. The proudly Capetonian has also opened for Twenty-One Pilots, while his two acclaimed albums, 2014’s Trading Change and 2018’s Critical Water, and their unique modern folk sound were the calling card for listeners around the globe.
