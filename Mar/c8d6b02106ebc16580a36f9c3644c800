Coworking spaces are shaping the future of how we work by finding innovative solutions that support employees holistically. Venture Workspace has steadily grown as the leading South African company in this field. Their centre locations are strategically chosen and designed to offer integrated, welcoming and functional coworking offices that are conducive to productivity and balance. The ideal position for this is in a suburban or remote area with beautiful surroundings and relaxing views. The goal is to bring workspaces to areas where people live, rather than focusing on overcrowded central business districts.  All you need to do is show up with your laptop and work. The rest is provided, and the centres are also set up to maintain power through load-shedding. By positioning themselves in smaller, upmarket shopping centres, Venture Workspace provides the basis for a simpler life-work balance. This is the accessibility and ease on offer. Since lockdown 2020 people are reassessing what is important to them, and a focus on balanced living has become the most important trend. Another focus is the social aspect. Coworking spaces allow clients the opportunity to form new connections. The opportunities to make friends are endless because different faces can be seen every day. Since people choose a coworking space in their area, this platform helps locals network to feel part of the community. If the last few years have taught us anything, it is that we should not be spending our lives tied to a desk. Rather than arranging our lives around our work, the future lies in flexible solutions that support our lifestyle choices. Coworking offices offer a range of choices to suit modern lifestyles. Venture Workspace’s ethos is underscored by constantly finding creative and innovative solutions to support a healthy and balanced approach to work and living.
